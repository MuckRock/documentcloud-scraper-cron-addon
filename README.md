# DocumentCloud Scraper Add-On

This scraper add-on will monitor a given site for documents and upload them to your DocumentCloud account.

Documents that are scrapped are tracked in a data.json file which is checked in to the repository.  If you copy this template or fork this repository, you may want to delete that file before pointing the scraper to a new site.
